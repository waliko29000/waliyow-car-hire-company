    <h1>Payment Processing Error</h1>
    <div id="error-explanation">
        <h2 class="section-title">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            We encountered an issue while attempting to process your payment.  This page provides information about the error, potential causes, and recommended steps to help you complete your transaction.  We understand that payment issues can be frustrating, and we are committed to providing you with clear and helpful guidance.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">2. Description of the Error</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The error you encountered means that your payment could not be successfully processed.  This occurred after you initiated the payment process and our system attempted to authorize the transaction with your payment provider.  The system received a response indicating that the payment could not be completed.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">3. Possible Causes</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Several factors can contribute to a payment processing error.  While we strive to ensure smooth transactions, issues can arise from various sources. Here are some of the most common causes:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-style">
            <li><strong>Temporary System Issues:</strong>  There may be a temporary disruption in our systems or the systems of our payment processors.  These disruptions are often resolved quickly.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Provider Issues:</strong>  Problems with your bank, credit card company, or other payment provider can sometimes interfere with the transaction.  This could include outages, maintenance, or communication problems.</li>
            <li><strong>Incorrect Payment Information:</strong>  If the payment information you entered (e.g., card number, expiration date, CVV) is incorrect, the payment will fail.</li>
            <li><strong>Insufficient Funds:</strong>  If your account lacks sufficient funds to cover the transaction, your payment provider will decline the payment.</li>
            <li><strong>Transaction Limits:</strong> Your payment provider may have limits on the amount or frequency of transactions, which could be exceeded.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Checks:</strong>  Your payment provider or our system may have flagged the transaction for additional security checks, and it could not be completed.</li>
            <li><strong>Connectivity Problems:</strong>  Interruptions in your internet connection during the payment process can sometimes lead to errors.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">4. Recommended Actions</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Please follow these steps to attempt to resolve the payment issue:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-style">
            <li><strong>1. Try Again Later:</strong>  The issue may be temporary.  Wait a few minutes (5-10 minutes) and try submitting your payment again.  This is often the simplest and most effective solution.</li>
            <li><strong>2. Verify Your Payment Details:</strong> Carefully review the payment information you entered to ensure it is accurate.  Pay close attention to card numbers, expiration dates, CVV codes, and billing addresses.</li>
            <li><strong>3. Check Your Account Balance:</strong>  Confirm that you have sufficient funds available in your account to complete the transaction.</li>
            <li><strong>4. Contact Your Payment Provider:</strong>  If you suspect there may be an issue with your account or if you are unsure about transaction limits, contact your bank, credit card company, or other payment provider.</li>
            <li><strong>5. Use an Alternative Payment Method:</strong> If possible, try using a different payment method (e.g., a different credit card, a different bank account, or another payment service).</li>
            <li><strong>6. Contact Our Customer Support:</strong> If you continue to experience problems, please contact our customer support team.  We are here to assist you and can provide further guidance.  Please provide them with any error messages you have received.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">5. Important Information Regarding Your Payment Information</h2>
